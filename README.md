This is a basic command-line to-do list application that allows you to add, remove, and list tasks.

Step 1

Deploying on EC2:

Launch an EC2 Instance:

Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Go to the EC2 Dashboard and launch a new EC2 instance, selecting an appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI), instance type, and other configuration settings.
Ensure that the security group associated with the instance allows incoming SSH (port 22) connections.

SSH into the EC2 Instance:

step 2

Use your terminal to SSH into the EC2 instance using its public IP or DNS.
Example: ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-ip

Upload Your Code:

Use scp to securely copy your Python code to the EC2 instance. I recommend using github.

Ensure Python is installed on the EC2 instance. If not, you can install it using sudo yum install python3 or sudo apt-get install python3.

Keep the Process Running:

To keep the process running even after you close the SSH connection, you can use tools like nohup or tmux.
