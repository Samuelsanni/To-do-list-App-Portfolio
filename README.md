Creating a clear and well-structured README for your project is essential for effective communication. Below is an improved version of your README portfolio, formatted for better readability and understanding:

# Command-Line To-Do List Application

This is a basic command-line to-do list application that allows you to add, remove, and list tasks. It also provides instructions on deploying it on an AWS EC2 instance.

## Deployment on AWS EC2

### Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Launch a new EC2 instance:
   - Select an appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
   - Choose the desired instance type.
   - Configure other necessary settings.
4. Ensure that the security group associated with the instance allows incoming SSH (port 22) connections.

### Step 2: SSH into the EC2 Instance

1. Open your terminal and SSH into the EC2 instance using its public IP or DNS.
   Example: `ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-ip`

### Step 3: Upload Your Code

1. Use `scp` to securely copy your Python code to the EC2 instance. You can consider using GitHub for version control and code hosting.

### Step 4: Ensure Python is Installed

1. Check if Python is installed on the EC2 instance. If not, you can install it using the following commands:
   - For Amazon Linux: `sudo yum install python3`
   - For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3`

### Step 5: Keep the Process Running

To keep the process running even after disconnecting from the SSH session, consider using tools like `nohup` and `tmux`:

- You can use `nohup` to run your Python script in the background: `nohup python3 your_script.py &`

- Alternatively, you can use `tmux` to create a persistent terminal session: 
  1. Install `tmux` if it's not already installed: `sudo yum install tmux` or `sudo apt-get install tmux`.
  2. Start a new `tmux` session: `tmux`.
  3. Run your Python script within the `tmux` session.
  4. Detach from the `tmux` session by pressing `Ctrl-b` followed by `d`.
  5. You can reattach to the `tmux` session later using `tmux attach`.

By following these steps, you can deploy and run your to-do list application on an AWS EC2 instance while keeping it running persistently.
